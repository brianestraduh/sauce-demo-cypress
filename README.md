# sauce-demo-cypress
This Project show cases my ability to create a test Automation Framework using Cypress.io
the following are important features supported,
  - multi environment  (local/test/prod) using cy.config.env dynamically change depending on npm command defined in the package.json
  - Authorization/Setup Project runs before the E2E test Suite saving time/resources by logging in ONLY once (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
  - Continuous integration using GIT ACTION ran using prod .env file parameters (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
  - Use Page Object Fixtures (pom-test.ts)to organize POM files (pages) making test files clean and eliminating repeated code (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

  DM me with any questions THANKS!
